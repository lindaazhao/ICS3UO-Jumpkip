# ICS3UO - Jumpkip
Jumpkip is my take on a game created using Pygame for my grade 11 computer science class, ICS3UO. I was inspired by Google's well-known dinosaur game, and chose to recreate it using my own style and elements (Mudkip from Pokemon!!). You can run the game just by downloading my code, as long as you have Pygame already installed on your computer. Hope you enjoy :)
